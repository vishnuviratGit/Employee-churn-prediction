# Employee Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

- This project uses machine learning to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on HR records.
- It includes complete data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, Building pipelines,  Model selection & hyperparameter tuning, data leakage prevention ,  evaluation, and deployment using a Streamlit web app.

## **Understand the business scenario and problem**

#### Project Goal:

- Help HR to identify employees at high risk of leaving the company.
- Provide actionable, data-driven insights to improve retention.
- Build a **reliable**, **interpretable**, and **production-ready** ML system using scikit-learn pipelines and Streamlit.

## Project Highlights

- **Best Model:** Tuned Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance:** AUC = 93.8% | Accuracy = 96.2% | F1 Score = 88.67% | Recall = 90.36 %
- **EDA:** Identified key attrition drivers such as  project overload, overwork, tenure, number of projects
- **Feature Engineering:** Introduced a binary **`overworked`** feature: employees working >175 hours/month.
- **Data Leakage Prevention:** Removed `satisfaction_level` and `average_monthly_hours`(as these may reflect post-decision bias in the company).
- **ML Pipeline/Tuning:** Used `Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`, and `GridSearchCV`
- **Deployment:** Interactive Streamlit app for real-time risk prediction and analysis

## Model Metrics for Best Selected Model(Random Forest)

| Metric    | Score  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Accuracy  | 96.2%  |
| Precision | 87%    |
| Recall    | 90.36% |
| F1 Score  | 88.67% |
| ROC-AUC   | 93.84% |

**Best Model:** The Random Forest model demonstrated the strongest performance.

**Key Metrics:**

- AUC: 93.8%  - This indicates an excellent ability to distinguish between employees who will leave and those who will stay.
- Precision: 87.0%  - This shows when the model predicts an employee will leave, it's correct around 87% (or more) of the time.
- Recall: 90.36%  - The model successfully identifies about 90% (or more) of employees who actually end up leaving and also shows strong identification of at-risk employees.
- F1-Score: 88.7%  - This shows a strong balance between precision and recall.
- Accuracy: 96.2% .Overall, the model makes correct predictions (leave/stay) for a very high percentage of employees.

## Summary of model results

**Logistic Regression**

The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set.

**Tree-based Machine Learning**

After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.
